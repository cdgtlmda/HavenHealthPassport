        'access_logs': await get_access_history(patient_id),
        'consent_history': await get_consent_records(patient_id)
    }

    # Generate machine-readable format
    return generate_portable_format(data)
```

    def __init__(self):
        self.checks = [
            self.check_encryption_status,
            self.check_access_patterns,
            self.check_data_retention,
            self.check_consent_validity,
            self.check_cross_border_transfers
        ]

    async def run_compliance_scan(self):
        results = []
        for check in self.checks:
            result = await check()
            results.append(result)
