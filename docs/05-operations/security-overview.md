# Haven Health Passport - Security Overview

## Security Architecture Principles

### 1. Zero Trust Security Model
- Never trust, always verify
- Least privilege access by default
- Continuous verification of all requests
- Microsegmentation of resources
- Encrypted communications everywhere

### 2. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security controls
- Redundant security mechanisms
- Fail-secure design patterns
- Security monitoring at all levels
- Automated threat response

### 3. Data Protection First
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Field-level encryption for PII/PHI
- Tokenization of sensitive data
- Secure key management
- Data loss prevention controls

## Authentication & Authorization

### Multi-Factor Authentication

Haven Health Passport implements a custom MFA solution with multiple authentication methods:

- **TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)**: Primary MFA method using authenticator apps
- **SMS Backup Codes**: Secondary method via Twilio integration
- **Recovery Codes**: One-time use backup codes for account recovery
- **Biometric Authentication**: Prepared for future implementation
- **WebAuthn/FIDO2**: Infrastructure ready for hardware security keys

The authentication system uses JWT tokens with secure session management and implements rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Patient: Own health records only
- Healthcare Provider: Authorized patient records
- Border Agent: Verification access only
- System Admin: Administrative functions
- Emergency Access: Time-limited override

## Encryption Strategy

### Key Hierarchy
```
Root KMS Key (AWS Managed)
├── Environment Keys (Customer Managed)
│   ├── Production Key
│   ├── Staging Key
│   └── Development Key
└── Data Encryption Keys (DEKs)
    ├── Database Encryption Keys
    ├── File Encryption Keys
    └── Communication Keys
```

### Encryption Implementation
- **AWS KMS**: Master key management
- **Envelope Encryption**: For large files
- **Field-Level Encryption**: For PII/PHI
- **TLS 1.3**: All API communications
- **E2E Encryption**: Patient-provider messaging

## Data Privacy Controls

### Personal Data Protection
- GDPR Article 17: Right to erasure
- GDPR Article 20: Data portability
- CCPA compliance for US residents
- Consent management system
- Privacy by design implementation

### Anonymization Techniques
- K-anonymity for analytics
- Differential privacy for aggregates
- Secure multi-party computation
- Homomorphic encryption for computations
- Zero-knowledge proofs for verification

## Network Security

### VPC Architecture
```yaml
Production VPC:
  CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16
  Public Subnets:
    - 10.0.1.0/24 (ALB only)
    - 10.0.2.0/24 (NAT Gateway)
  Private Subnets:
    - 10.0.10.0/24 (Application tier)
    - 10.0.11.0/24 (Application tier)
  Database Subnets:
    - 10.0.20.0/24 (RDS/HealthLake)
    - 10.0.21.0/24 (RDS/HealthLake)
```

### Security Groups
- Principle of least privilege
- Stateful firewall rules
- No default allow rules
- Regular audit and cleanup
- Automated compliance checking

## Application Security

### Input Validation
- Parameterized queries only
- Input sanitization layers
- File upload restrictions
- API rate limiting
- Request size limits

### Secure Development
- SAST/DAST in CI/CD pipeline
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container image scanning
- Infrastructure as Code scanning
- Security code reviews

## Incident Response

### Detection & Response
1. **Automated Detection**
   - CloudWatch anomaly detection
   - GuardDuty threat detection
