# Consenter Set Configuration - Implementation Summary

## Completed: Define Consenter Set

### What was implemented:

1. **Consenter Set Generator (TypeScript)**
   - Created `/blockchain/src/consensus/consenter-set-generator.ts`
   - Implements a comprehensive generator class for creating consenter configurations
   - Includes type definitions for all configuration aspects
   - Generates a 5-node Raft consensus configuration

2. **Configuration Files**
   - Created `/blockchain/config/consensus/consenter-set-template.json`
   - JSON template with 5 consenter nodes distributed across availability zones
   - Placeholder certificates ready for AWS Managed Blockchain integration

3. **Documentation**
   - Created `/blockchain/docs/consenter-set-configuration.md`
   - Comprehensive documentation explaining:
     - Node distribution strategy (2 nodes in us-east-1a, 2 in us-east-1b, 1 in us-east-1c)
     - Node roles (Primary, Secondary, Arbiter)
     - Consensus parameters (Quorum=3, Election timeout=5000ms, Heartbeat=500ms)
     - TLS configuration requirements
     - Implementation guide with AWS CLI commands

4. **Scripts**
   - Created `/blockchain/scripts/generate-consenter-set.ts`
   - CLI script to generate consenter set configuration
   - Includes validation logic for configuration correctness

   - Created `/blockchain/scripts/configure-consenter-set.sh`
   - Shell script for applying consenter configuration to AWS Managed Blockchain

5. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Created `/blockchain/tests/consenter-set.test.ts`
   - Test data structures for validating consenter configurations

### Key Configuration Details:

- **5-node Raft cluster** for fault tolerance (can tolerate 2 node failures)
- **Quorum size**: 3 (majority of 5)
- **Node distribution**: Across 3 availability zones for high availability
- **TLS**: Mutual TLS required for all consenter communication
- **Performance**: bc.m5.xlarge instances with optimized buffer sizes
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch integration for consensus metrics
- **Disaster Recovery**: S3-based backup with 30-day retention

### Next Steps:
The next unchecked item in the checklist is "Configure election parameters" which will build upon this consenter set definition.
