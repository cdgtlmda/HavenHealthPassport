# Heartbeat Interval Configuration - Implementation Summary

## Completed: Set Heartbeat Interval

### What was implemented:

1. **Heartbeat Interval Manager**
   - Created `/blockchain/src/consensus/heartbeat-interval-manager.ts`
   - Comprehensive manager class for heartbeat configuration
   - Adaptive interval adjustment based on network conditions
   - Jitter implementation to prevent thundering herd

2. **Configuration Files**
   - Created `/blockchain/config/consensus/heartbeat-interval-production.yaml`
   - Production-ready configuration with 500ms interval
   - Integration with election parameters and leader lease

3. **Configuration Scripts**
   - Created `/blockchain/scripts/configure-heartbeat-interval.ts`
   - TypeScript CLI for configuring and validating heartbeat settings
   - Created `/blockchain/scripts/configure-heartbeat-aws.sh`
   - Shell script for applying configuration to AWS Managed Blockchain

4. **Documentation**
   - Created `/blockchain/docs/heartbeat-interval-guide.md`
   - Comprehensive guide explaining heartbeat timing
   - Tuning recommendations for different network conditions
   - Monitoring and alerting guidelines

5. **Testing**
   - Created `/blockchain/tests/heartbeat-interval.test.ts`
   - Unit tests for interval calculation and jitter
   - Tests for adaptive behavior and timeout calculation

6. **Integration Module**
   - Created `/blockchain/src/consensus/timing-integration.ts`
   - Integrates heartbeat interval with election parameters
   - Validates timing consistency across consensus settings

### Key Configuration Details:

- **Heartbeat Interval**: 500ms (optimized for cloud networks)
- **Follower Timeout**: 5000ms (10x heartbeat interval)
- **Grace Period**: 500ms additional buffer
- **Jitter**: Â±50ms to prevent synchronized heartbeats
- **Adaptive Range**: 100ms - 5000ms based on network conditions

### Timing Relationships:
- Heartbeat: 500ms (1 tick)
- Election Timeout: 5000ms (10 ticks)
- Leader Lease: 10000ms (20 ticks)

### Monitoring Configuration:
- Success rate threshold: 95%
- Latency threshold: 250ms
- Missed heartbeat alert: After 3 consecutive misses

The heartbeat interval is now properly configured to ensure reliable leader-follower communication while minimizing network overhead.
