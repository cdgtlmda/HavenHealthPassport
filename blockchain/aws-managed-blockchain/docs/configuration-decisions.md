| 2024-01-01 | Set 50% voting threshold | Balance between security and operational flexibility | Democratic governance model |
| 2024-01-01 | 24-hour proposal duration | Accommodate global operations across time zones | Fair voting window for all members |
| 2024-01-01 | Raft consensus for ordering | AWS managed, no additional configuration needed | High availability ordering service |
| 2024-01-01 | Multi-AZ peer deployment | High availability and disaster recovery | Automatic failover capability |
| 2024-01-01 | 30-day log retention | Balance between compliance and cost | Sufficient for audit requirements |
| 2024-01-01 | VPC endpoint deployment | Private connectivity without internet exposure | Enhanced security posture |
| 2024-01-01 | Restrictive security groups | Only allow required Fabric ports | Minimize attack surface |
| 2024-01-01 | Enable VPC flow logs | Network traffic monitoring and forensics | Security compliance |

### Architecture Decisions

#### Network Topology
- **Decision**: Multi-AZ deployment with 3 peer nodes initially
- **Rationale**:
  - High availability across availability zones
  - Sufficient redundancy for production workloads
  - Room to scale up to 5 nodes if needed
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Single AZ: Rejected due to availability concerns
  - 5 nodes initially: Rejected due to cost without immediate need

#### Instance Types
- **Decision**: Start with bc.t3.large for production
- **Rationale**:
  - Good balance of compute and memory
  - Cost-effective for initial deployment
  - Can scale up to bc.m5 or bc.c5 as needed
- **Performance Targets**:
  - 500 TPS initially
  - Sub-2 second transaction confirmation
#### Security Configuration
- **Decision**: Private VPC endpoint with restrictive security groups
- **Rationale**:
  - No internet exposure for blockchain network
  - Only allow traffic from authorized sources
  - Defense in depth with security groups and NACLs
- **Security Controls**:
  - TLS encryption for all communications
  - Certificate-based authentication
  - VPC flow logs for monitoring

#### Monitoring Strategy
- **Decision**: CloudWatch Logs with 30-day retention
- **Rationale**:
  - Native AWS integration
  - Sufficient for operational troubleshooting
  - Cost-effective retention period
- **Log Types**:
  - Peer node logs
  - CA logs
  - Chaincode execution logs
  - VPC flow logs (90-day retention)

### Future Considerations

1. **Scaling Strategy**
   - Monitor transaction throughput
   - Add peer nodes as load increases
   - Consider bc.m5 instances for memory-intensive workloads

2. **Network Expansion**
   - Plan for adding new members
   - Define member onboarding process
   - Create governance framework for voting

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Optimize chaincode execution
   - Consider state database indexing

4. **Compliance Enhancements**
   - Implement HIPAA audit controls
   - Add data encryption at rest
   - Enhanced access logging

### Review Schedule

- **Quarterly**: Review performance metrics and scaling needs
- **Semi-Annual**: Review security configuration and compliance
- **Annual**: Review architecture decisions and future roadmap
