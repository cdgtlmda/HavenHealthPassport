# Heartbeat Interval Configuration
# Haven Health Passport - Production Settings

# Core heartbeat settings for Raft consensus
heartbeat:
  # Base interval in milliseconds
  interval: 500

  # Timing parameters in Raft ticks
  ticks:
    heartbeatTick: 1      # 1 tick = 500ms
    electionTick: 10      # 10 ticks = 5000ms
    tickInterval: "500ms" # Base tick duration

  # Follower timeout calculation
  follower:
    timeoutMultiplier: 10    # Timeout = interval * 10 = 5000ms
    gracePeriod: 500         # Additional 500ms grace
    effectiveTimeout: 5500   # Total timeout: 5500ms

  # Jitter configuration to prevent thundering herd
  jitter:
    enabled: true
    range: 50               # Â±50ms random jitter

  # Network adaptation
  adaptive:
    enabled: true
    minInterval: 100        # Never go below 100ms
    maxInterval: 5000       # Never exceed 5 seconds

# Integration with election parameters
electionIntegration:
  # Heartbeat must be less than election timeout
  maxHeartbeatRatio: 0.1    # Heartbeat = 10% of election timeout

  # Coordination with leader lease
  leaseRenewalHeartbeats: 3 # Renew lease every 3 heartbeats

# Performance settings
performance:
  # Batch heartbeats with other messages
  batching:
    enabled: true
    maxWait: 100            # Wait up to 100ms to batch

  # Connection management
  connections:
    keepAlive: true
    poolSize: 5             # Connection pool per follower

# Monitoring
monitoring:
  # CloudWatch metrics
  metrics:
    namespace: "HavenHealth/Blockchain/Heartbeat"
    interval: 60            # Publish metrics every 60s

  # Alerts
  alerts:
    missedHeartbeats: 3     # Alert after 3 missed heartbeats
    latencyThreshold: 250   # Alert if heartbeat takes > 250ms
