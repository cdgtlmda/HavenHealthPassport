# Voice Confirmation Protocols Documentation

## Overview

The Voice Confirmation Protocols module provides a comprehensive system for requesting and validating user confirmations for voice commands in the Haven Health Passport system. It implements multiple confirmation strategies with accessibility support and risk-based security levels.

## Key Features

### 1. Multiple Confirmation Types
- **Verbal Yes/No**: Simple affirmative/negative responses
- **Verbal Repeat**: User repeats key information for accuracy
- **Numeric Code**: 4-digit code confirmation for high-security operations
- **Multiple Choice**: Selection from a list of options
- **Biometric**: Voice biometric verification (future implementation)
- **PIN**: Personal identification number entry
- **Dual Confirmation**: Combination of two methods for critical operations

### 2. Risk-Based Security Levels
- **NONE**: No confirmation needed (navigation, search)
- **LOW**: Simple yes/no confirmation (settings changes)
- **MEDIUM**: Repeat confirmation (medication updates)
- **HIGH**: Numeric code (data deletion, sharing)
- **CRITICAL**: Multiple confirmation methods (delete all records)

### 3. Multi-Language Support
- Confirmation prompts in 50+ languages
- Language-specific response validation
- Cultural adaptation for confirmation patterns

### 4. Accessibility Features
- Vision impaired: Audio-only confirmations with detailed descriptions
- Hearing impaired: Visual confirmations with haptic feedback
- Motor impaired: Extended timeouts and simplified inputs
- Cognitive support: Step-by-step guidance with repetition

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **ConfirmationProtocolManager**: Main orchestrator for confirmation flows
2. **ConfirmationStrategy**: Abstract base for different confirmation methods
3. **ConfirmationContext**: Contextual information for intelligent decisions
4. **ConfirmationRequest/Response**: Data structures for the confirmation flow

### Confirmation Flow

```
1. Command Received
   ↓
2. Risk Assessment
   ↓
3. Determine Confirmation Level
   ↓
4. Select Confirmation Type (based on context)
   ↓
5. Generate Confirmation Request
   ↓
6. Present to User (with timeout)
   ↓
7. Validate Response
   ↓
8. Execute Command or Retry
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Medication Confirmation

```python
# User says: "Add medication aspirin 100mg"
# System: "Please confirm: Add medication aspirin 100mg. Say 'yes' to confirm or 'no' to cancel."
# User: "Yes"
# System: Executes command
```

### High-Security Deletion

```python
# User says: "Delete all medical records"
# System: "This will permanently delete all medical records. Please say the confirmation code: 4 7 2 9"
# User: "Four seven two nine"
# System: "Are you absolutely sure? Say 'delete all' to confirm."
# User: "Delete all"
# System: Executes deletion
```

### Accessibility Example

```python
# User (vision impaired): "Share records with Dr. Smith"
# System: "You are about to share your complete medical records with Doctor Smith.
#          This includes all medications, test results, and visit history.
#          To confirm, please repeat: Share with Smith"
# User: "Share with Smith"
# System: Executes sharing
```

## Configuration

### Command Type Mappings

| Command Type | Default Level | Adjustable |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
| EMERGENCY | NONE | No |
| DELETE | HIGH | Yes |
| MEDICATION | MEDIUM | Yes |
| SHARE | HIGH | Yes |
| NAVIGATION | NONE | No |

### Risk Adjustments

Certain keywords or patterns trigger higher confirmation levels:
- "dose change" → HIGH
- "delete all" → CRITICAL
- "emergency contact" → HIGH
- "share with third party" → HIGH

### Timeout Configuration

| Level | Default Timeout | Extensible |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| LOW | 15 seconds | Yes |
| MEDIUM | 30 seconds | Yes |
| HIGH | 45 seconds | Yes |
| CRITICAL | 60 seconds | Yes |

## Error Handling

### Retry Logic
- Maximum 3 attempts per confirmation request
- Progressive hints on failed attempts
- Automatic cancellation after max attempts

### Timeout Handling
- Graceful timeout with option to restart
- Notification before timeout expires
- Command saved for quick retry

### Ambiguous Responses
- Confidence scoring for all responses
- Threshold-based acceptance (>0.7 confidence)
- Clarification requests for ambiguous inputs

## Integration Points

### Voice Command Grammar
- Integrates with CommandGrammar for command parsing
- Uses CommandPriority for urgency assessment
- Respects confirmation_required flag

### Audio System
- Async audio callbacks for prompts
- Integration with Amazon Polly for multi-language
- Support for SSML for better pronunciations

### User Profiles
- Personalized confirmation preferences
- Accessibility settings integration
- Historical success rate tracking

## Security Considerations

1. **No Storage of Sensitive Confirmations**: Numeric codes and PINs are never logged
2. **Time-Limited Codes**: All codes expire after single use or timeout
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force attempts on numeric codes
4. **Audit Trail**: All confirmation attempts are logged (without sensitive data)

## Performance Metrics

- Average confirmation time: <5 seconds for yes/no
- Successful confirmation rate: >95% target
- Timeout rate: <5% target
- Accessibility mode success rate: >90% target

## Future Enhancements

1. **Voice Biometrics**: Speaker verification for high-security operations
2. **Contextual Adaptation**: Learn user patterns for smarter confirmations
3. **Gesture Support**: Head nod/shake detection via camera
4. **Haptic Feedback**: Vibration patterns for confirmation on mobile
5. **Blockchain Verification**: Immutable confirmation records for critical operations
