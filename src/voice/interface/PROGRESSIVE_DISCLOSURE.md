# Voice Progressive Disclosure Documentation

## Overview

The Progressive Disclosure module implements an intelligent system for gradually revealing voice interface features based on user proficiency, ensuring new users aren't overwhelmed while power users have access to advanced functionality.

## Key Concepts

### Disclosure Levels

The system uses five levels of interface complexity:

1. **ESSENTIAL** (Level 1)
   - Emergency commands
   - Basic navigation
   - Show medications
   - Help commands

2. **BASIC** (Level 2)
   - Add/remove medications
   - Check appointments
   - Basic health record management

3. **INTERMEDIATE** (Level 3)
   - Share medical records
   - Export data
   - Advanced search
   - Customization options

4. **ADVANCED** (Level 4)
   - Bulk operations
   - Voice macros
   - Complex workflows
   - Automation features

5. **EXPERT** (Level 5)
   - API control
   - Experimental features
   - Developer options
   - System configuration

### Progression Mechanisms

Users advance through levels based on:

1. **Interaction Count**: Number of successful commands
2. **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful interactions
3. **Time-Based**: Days since first use
4. **Feature Mastery**: Demonstrated proficiency with current features
5. **Adaptive Learning**: System learns user patterns

## Architecture

## User Profiles

Each user profile tracks:
```python
{
    "user_id": "string",
    "current_level": "ESSENTIAL|BASIC|INTERMEDIATE|ADVANCED|EXPERT",
    "capability": "BEGINNER|INTERMEDIATE|ADVANCED|EXPERT",
    "features_unlocked": ["feature_ids"],
    "features_used": {"feature_id": usage_count},
    "interaction_history": [...],
    "preferences": {...},
    "total_interactions": 0,
    "successful_interactions": 0
}
```

## Feature Definition

Features are defined with:
```python
Feature(
    id="unique_identifier",
    name="Human Readable Name",
    category=FeatureCategory.MEDICATIONS,
    min_level=DisclosureLevel.BASIC,
    command_examples=["Add medication aspirin"],
    description="Add a new medication",
    prerequisites=["other_feature_ids"],
    is_dangerous=False,
    requires_confirmation=True
)
```

## Disclosure Rules

Rules determine when to unlock new features:

### Example Rules

1. **Basic Unlock Rule**
   - Condition: 5+ successful interactions
   - Unlocks: Basic medication and appointment features

2. **Intermediate Unlock Rule**
   - Condition: 80% success rate with 20+ interactions
   - Unlocks: Sharing and export features

3. **Time-Based Rule**
   - Condition: 30 days of usage
   - Unlocks: Additional intermediate features

4. **Mastery Rule**
   - Condition: 70% of current features used 5+ times
   - Unlocks: Next level features

## Usage Patterns

### New User Experience

```
Day 1: Essential Features Only
- "Show my medications"
- "Help"
- "Emergency"

After 5 successful commands: Basic Features Unlocked
- "Add medication aspirin"
- "Check appointments"
- "Update profile"

After demonstrating proficiency: Intermediate Features
- "Share records with Dr. Smith"
- "Export health data"
```

### Adaptive Suggestions

The system suggests features based on:
1. Current user level
2. Usage patterns
3. Similar user behaviors
4. Context and timing

## Accessibility Adaptations

### Cognitive Support
- Slower progression (50% speed)
- Limited feature set (max 3 visible)
- Simplified language
- Extended help
- No automatic progression past basic

### Motor Impairments
- Same features, extended timeouts
- Repetition allowed
- Simplified confirmation

### Vision Impairments
- Detailed audio descriptions
- Voice-first navigation
- No visual-only features

## Onboarding Flow

New users go through guided steps:

1. **Welcome Step**
   - Learn basic navigation
   - Try "Show my medications"

2. **Emergency Access**
   - Learn emergency commands
   - Understand always-available help

3. **Help System**
   - Learn to ask for help
   - Explore available commands

## Analytics and Metrics

The system tracks:

### User Progression
- Time between levels
- Success rates at each level
- Feature adoption rates
- Abandonment points

### Feature Effectiveness
- Usage frequency
- Success rates
- User satisfaction
- Time to mastery

### System Performance
- Average progression speed
- Level distribution
- Feature popularity
- Error patterns

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Simple
- Show only essential features initially
- Use clear, simple language
- Provide immediate value

### 2. Progressive Complexity
- Introduce features gradually
- Build on previous knowledge
- Group related features

### 3. Clear Feedback
- Celebrate milestones
- Explain new unlocks
- Provide learning tips

### 4. Respect User Pace
- Allow different learning speeds
- Don't force progression
- Provide manual overrides

### 5. Context Awareness
- Emergency always accessible
- Adapt to usage patterns
- Consider time and location

## Configuration

### Customizing Levels

```python
# Define custom disclosure levels
custom_levels = {
    "beginner": ["emergency", "help", "show_medications"],
    "intermediate": ["add_medication", "appointments"],
    "advanced": ["share", "export", "bulk_operations"]
}
```

### Adjusting Rules

```python
# Create custom progression rules
DisclosureRule(
    id="custom_rule",
    condition_type="interaction_count",
    threshold=10,
    target_level=DisclosureLevel.INTERMEDIATE,
    features_to_unlock=["custom_feature"],
    message="You've unlocked custom features!"
)
```

### Feature Categories

Organize features by:
- Emergency
- Navigation
- Health Records
- Medications
- Appointments
- Vitals
- Sharing
- Settings
- Advanced
- Experimental

## Integration

### With Voice Commands

```python
# Filter commands by user level
available_commands = interface_adapter.filter_available_commands(
    user_id="user123",
    all_commands=grammar_engine.get_all_commands()
)
```

### With Error Correction

```python
# Adjust error correction based on level
if user_level == DisclosureLevel.ESSENTIAL:
    # Provide more detailed help
    error_flow.extended_help = True
```

### With Confirmation

```python
# Adjust confirmation requirements
if user_level == DisclosureLevel.EXPERT:
    # Reduce confirmations for experts
    confirmation_level = ConfirmationLevel.LOW
```

## Future Enhancements

   - Predict optimal progression paths
   - Personalize feature recommendations
   - Identify struggling users

2. **Community Learning**
